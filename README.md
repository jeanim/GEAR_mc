GEAR_mc 
=======
GEAR_mc is a fork of Jeremie Passerin's GEAR project.

GEAR is an open source project to provide a complete and production quality toolset 
for rigging and animation inside Autodesk SoftimageÂ™. It includes a lot of things to 
ease the rigging and animation workflows.

Anyone should be able to build custom rigs using GEAR. It has been designed to be 
flexible and relatively easy to use. Even non-riggers can create advanced rigs and 
animate them easily, but the system is also open to further expansion so TDs can create 
their own "components" and use them inside of the GEAR Rigging System. Furthermore, everything 
is accessible through scripting with a complete API to automate as much as possible.
